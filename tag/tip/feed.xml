&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three parts to the IELTS speaking test (DUH!). In the first part of the test the examiner asks you some personal questions (e.g. what’s your favorite color?). The problem is, sometimes candidates get confused because their real answer to some of these questions is “NO”, but because at some point in their life someone pulled her/his lips apart from theirs and looked them in the eye and said-in a low, celestial voice- “DO NOT GIVE SHORT ANSWERS”, they assume “NO” in the IELTS speaking test, like smoking in everyday life, KILLS. Good news is, unlike smoking, saying “NO” actually can get you out of trouble in part 1. Even if you’re an accomplished liar and can think of minor details to include in your imaginary plot, you’d be better off telling the truth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-say-no-in-part-1-and-feel-good-about-it&quot;&gt;HOW TO SAY NO IN PART 1 AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that saying NO is not enough on the IELTS test, because that’ll be too short to allow the examiner to assess your language skills. So what should we do?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is fairly simple. All you have to do is explain why you think the answer is NO. You can give some relevant details, or make some examples, or do virtually anything else that can help support your answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the question and the answer below to get a better understanding of how telling the truth (NO) can help you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;   Do you often watch TV?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Erm…actually I should say no, not at all. It’s been five years now that I haven’t watched TV for even a single second. I prefer reading, and it’ll come extremely out of character for me to watch TV. When I was a child though, I used to watch cartoons on TV, but the thing is as I grew up, I began to realize TV programs are nothing but boring, and they make me sick to stomach! And that’s all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-your-turn-now&quot;&gt;IT’S YOUR TURN NOW!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the following question and feel free to say NO! record your voice and send it to our admins to get feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has television changed your life in any way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m gonna say NO…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your recorded voice to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@bineshafza.ir&quot; title=&quot;Binesh Afza Email&quot;&gt;our email address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
